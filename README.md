# Geothermal Power Output Prediction (GPOP)

**GPOP** is a proof-of-concept machine learning application designed specifically for binary cycle geothermal power plant operators, engineers, and analysts. It leverages advanced time series forecasting and XGBoost regression to predict geothermal power output based on operational parameters, helping optimize plant performance and inform strategic decisions about well drilling and maintenance.


### üéØ **Core Purpose**
GPOP helps geothermal power plant operators:
- **Predict future power output** based on current operational conditions
- **Optimize production planning** by understanding how different parameters affect power generation
- **Plan strategic interventions** like make-up well drilling to maintain production levels
- **Analyze long-term production trends** and their impact on plant profitability
- **Identify operational anomalies** through data analysis and visualization

### üè≠ **Real-World Applications**

1. **Daily Operations**: Predict tomorrow's power output based on current plant conditions
2. **Strategic Planning**: Model long-term production decline and plan interventions
3. **Well Drilling Decisions**: Simulate the impact of new make-up wells on production
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track key performance indicators and identify optimization opportunities
5. **Risk Assessment**: Understand how changes in operational parameters affect output reliability

### üîß **Key Operational Parameters**
The app typically works with standard geothermal plant data including:
- Brine flowrate (T/h)
- Steam/NCG flowrate (T/h) 
- Ambient temperature (¬∞C)
- Heat exchanger pressure differentials (Bar)
- Wellhead temperatures and pressures
- Other plant-specific operational metrics

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the Application**: Run `streamlit run src/app.py`
2. **Choose Your Approach**:
   - Use the pre-trained default model for immediate predictions
   - Upload your own data to then retrain a custom model either through the app or through `streamlit run src/create_defailt_model.py`
3. **Explore Your Data**: Use the analysis tabs to understand your data patterns
4. **Make Predictions**: Input current conditions to get power output forecasts
5. **Plan for the Future**: Use long-term forecasting to inform strategic decisions regarding MUWs.

### Data Requirements
Your data should be in CSV or Excel format with:
- **Timestamp Column**: Date/time information for each measurement
- **Operational Parameters**: Flowrates, temperatures, pressures, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Historical power output (for training)
- **Regular Intervals**: Consistent time spacing between measurements (hourly recommended)

### Best Practices
- **Data Quality**: Ensure your data is clean with minimal gaps
- **Feature Selection**: Include all relevant operational parameters
- **Validation**: Always review prediction warnings and validate results against operational knowledge
- **Regular Updates**: Retrain models periodically with new data to maintain accuracy
